Marajoensis IPA is a recipe of an IPA with mosaic Dry Hop and Jambu leaves.

# Base recipe

This beer is based on a DIY kit from Coopers, Brew A IPA. http://store.coopers.com.au/recipes/index/view/id/57/

The fermentation step should be kept from 20C to 24C, preferable 22C. A good idea is to start from 20C for one or two days and increase the temperature one degree a day until 24C in the final days.

After the fermentation, add  50g of Mosaic hop in a bag for the dry hop, with some leaves of Jambu. https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambu

After five days, remove the hop bag and put the beer in a refrigerator starting with the maximum temperature (lower number in the display, and increase one degree a day for maturation. It will stabilize the molecules.

After about seven days, make a syrup with sugar, 5g to 8g for liter. For example, 20 L -> 160g maximum. Tip: Put some wather in a cup, leave it for 2 minutes in the microwave. Turn it off, stir it a litle, put it back for more 30 seconds, stir it again. Repeate this steps for 3 times. You have to pay attention because it may boil, if this happen turn off the microwave and stir it.

Wait for it to decrease the temperature. I use two ice packs to speed it up. Take extra care to avoid any insect or contamination agent to get into the syrup, I use to cover with a plastic film.

Drop with care in the beer, use a spoon close to the beer to avoid bubles, it might oxidate your beer.

Stir the beer gently to avoid bubles also, for the same reason.

Fill your bottles and wait for 10 days to enjoy your beer.

# Origin of the name

Marajoensis is part of the scientific name of a snake from the North of Brazil, where the leaves of Jambu are common.
